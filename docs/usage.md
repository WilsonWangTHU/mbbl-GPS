Intended Usage
==============

The intended command line usage is through the gps_main.py script:
```sh
cd /path/to/gps
python python/gps/gps_main.py -h
usage: gps_main.py [-h] [-n] [-t] [-r N] experiment

Run the Guided Policy Search algorithm.

positional arguments:
  experiment         experiment name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -n, --new          create new experiment
  -t, --targetsetup  run target setup
  -r N, --resume N   resume training from iter N
  -p N, --policy N   take N policy samples (for BADMM only)
```
Usage:
* `python python/gps/gps_main.py <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -n`

  Creates a new experiment folder at  `experiments/<EXPERIMENT_NAME>` with a hyperparams file `hyperparams.py` (and possibly a targets file `targets.npz`) copied from the previous experiment created. Change `hyperparams.py` to specify the new experiment.

* `python python/gps/gps_main.py <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -t` (for ROS only)

  Opens the Target Setup GUI, for target setup when using ROS. See the [Target Setup GUI](gui.html#target-setup-gui-for-ros-only) section for details.

* `python python/gps/gps_main.py <EXPERIMENT_NAME>`

  Opens the GPS Training GUI and runs the guided policy search algorithm for your specific experiment hyperparams. See the [GPS Training GUI](gui.html#gps-training-gui) section for details.

* `python python/gps/gps_main.py <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -r N`

  Resumes the guided policy search algorithm, loading the algorithm state from iteration N. (The file `experiments/<EXPERIMENT_NAME>/data_files/algorithm_itr_<N>.pkl` must exist.)

* `python python/gps/gps_main.py <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p N`

  Takes N policy samples from the most recent algorithm state, for testing the policy to see how it is behaving. (The file `experiments/<EXPERIMENT_NAME>/data_files/algorithm_itr_<N>.pkl` must exist.)


For your reference, your experiments folder contains the following:

  * `data_files/` - holds the data files.
    * `data_files/algorithm_itr_<N>.pkl` - the algorithm state at iteration N.
    * `data_files/traj_samples_itr_<N>.pkl` - the trajectory samples collected at iteration N.
    * `data_files/pol_samples_itr_<N>.pkl` - the policy samples collected at iteration N.
    * `data_files/figure_itr_<N>.png` - an image of the GPS Training GUI figure at iteration N.
  * `hyperparams.py` - the hyperparams used for this experiment. For more details, see [this page](hyperparams.html).
  * `log.txt` - the log text of output from the Target Setup GUI and the GPS Training GUI.
  * `targets.npz` - the initial and target state used for this experiment (ROS agent only -- set for other agents in hyperparams.py)

To shorten gps commands, we suggest that you create an alias in your bashrc:
```sh
echo "alias gps='python /path/to/gps/python/gps/gps_main.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
cd /path/to/gps             # (only required for MuJoCo experiments)
gps -h                      # help
gps <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -n    # new experiment
gps <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -t    # target setup
gps <EXPERIMENT_NAME>       # run training
gps <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -r N  # resume training
gps <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p N  # test policy
```
